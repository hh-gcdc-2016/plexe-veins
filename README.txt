Hello guys, 

First of all, I recommend you to install OMNeT++ IDE, it's very useful to navigate through plexe-veins code. Follow the guide here >> https://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/InstallGuide.pdf

Plexe documentation is here >> http://plexe.car2x.org/documentation/plexe-1.1-documentation.pdf

Not sure if this is the best page but if you're interested in implementing a car-following model >> http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Developer/Implementation_Notes/Vehicle_Models
